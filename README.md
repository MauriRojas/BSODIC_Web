# BSOD Information Center Web Application

BSODIC is a project that allows me and my associate keep track of the current and past jobs.
We can add clients, devices (notebooks, PCs, phones, etc.) that we work with.
A client, a device and a date togheter constitute a job, that can be paid or not.

The last working version of the software is a desktop application, but now I'm developing the web version.
